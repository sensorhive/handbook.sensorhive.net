# Marco Polo

*Marco Polo* is the [discovery protocol](https://protocol.sensorhive.net/discovery/) used by [sensorhive](https://sensorhive.net) to find other hives on a network. The sensorhive application that implements the discovery protocol is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sensorhive/marco-polo).

*Marco Polo* runs as a service on your systems and keeps track of any new hives or sensors joining and leaving your network.
